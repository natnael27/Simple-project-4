# Simple java project
This code splits the Address, Employee and Main classes into separate files, Address.java, Employee.java and Main.java respectively. 
You can compile and run the Main.java file to execute the program.

In this program, we define an Address class with three instance variables: streetName, houseNumber, and city. 
We then define a constructor that takes these three variables as parameters and initializes them using the this keyword. 
We also define getter methods to access the instance variables.

We then define an Employee class with four instance variables: name, id, salary, and address. 
We define a constructor that takes these four variables as parameters and initializes them using the thiskeyword. 
We also define getter and setter methods to access and modify the instance variables, and a nameTokenizing() method that tokenizes the name instance variable and prints the tokens.

In the Main class, we create an Address object and an Employee object with initial values. 
We then call the nameTokenizing() method on the employee1 object to tokenize its name and print the tokens.
